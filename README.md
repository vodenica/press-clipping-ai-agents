# press-clipping-ai-agents
This project will consist of prompts and answers related to building an AI Agent(s) that extracts news based on specific keywords. The result will be provided as a report, including the title of the news, a brief overview, the date the report was generated, and the AI agent used.

### AI Agent System prompt (check)

For the purposes of creating an AI agent that will work as a "Press Clipping" agency application, it will conduct **deep research** and **scrape** the data and information on news media platforms on dedicated URLs on the internet for particular terms. Additionally, social media accounts associated with these news media portals will be used by AI agents to scrape all data and information related to specific terms. Please outline the System Prompt, which will consist of a detailed explanation for each of its parts, including: Role, Task, Context, Reasoning, Output, and Stopping. 
The research agents shall focus on two time frames concerning the search terms and how these terms appeared in the last 24 hours and within the last 72 hours. Considering that the AI Agent is activated automatically every morning at 06:00 am, or can be activated simply by calling it, the agent will focus on **deep research** and **extraction** of the data and information that occurs after 06:00 am for that day. The research agent shall send an email to the designated email address, accompanied by a report containing all the found information and search results for the news media and for the activities of the political parties, which is explained below, following the structure of the "Markdown file" called **"mediaportals.md"**.
The complete overview and the list of all targeted media with URLs and social media accounts are attached as a "Markdown" format file, where a table lists media portals' URLs and social media accounts. Based on this data, AI Agents shall conduct in-depth research and extract the information, including a brief description and a URL to that information. It is essential that the "Markdown" file called **"mediaportals.md"** is attached to this AI agents repository, containing a table with URLs and social media accounts arranged from most important to least important. That said, the column with number 1 has the highest priority, and the row with the highest number is the lowest priority. In addition to this "Markdown file", it consists of two parts: one part refers to the news media portals and their social media accounts, and the second part provides an overview of the political parties and their activities, including their party URLs and social media accounts. 
The deep research agent shall be made on the "you.com" platform and shall be based on the Langchain Agademy Deep Research Agent repository that could be found on the URL (https://github.com/langchain-ai/deep_research_from_scratch).
It is essential to note that the final report should be in the form of an email-ready document, either in **HTML** or **Markdown** format, as the result will be sent via email.
